Why We Fight scooped the grand jury prize for documentaries at the worlds leading independent film festival. British director Sean McAllisters The Liberace of Baghdad - about a pianist in war-torn Iraq - won a special prize in the world documentary category. Both Why We Fight and The Liberace of Baghdad were made for the BBC. Why We Fight is due to be screened on BBC Four in March.  The Sundance festival was founded by actor Robert Redford in 1981. This years festival - which ended on Sunday after a 11-day run - has been dominated by the themes of war and politics. In the new world cinema drama category, the Angolan film The Hero triumphed to win the grand jury prize. The film - an Angolan/French/Portuguese production - tells the story of a veteran of the countrys civil war who returns home to face a new battle of survival. Twelve films competing in the new world cinema documentary category focused on countries and people under siege.  Finnish film The Three Rooms of Melancholia looks at the war in Chechnya and Shake Hands With The Devil: The Journey of Romeo Dallaire tells the story of a UN mission to Rwanda during the 1994 genocide. But it was Dutch documentary Shape of the Moon - a study of an extended family in Indonesia - which took the top prize. Meanwhile, French-Israeli production Wall, which looks at Israels controversial security wall separating it from the Palestinian territories, picked up a world cinema special jury prize for documentaries. In the main drama category, Forty Shades of Blue was named winner of the grand jury prize. The film tells the tale of a forbidden tug-of-love between a father, his Russian immigrant girlfriend and his son.  During its 24-year history, the Sundance Film Festival has showcased successes such as Reservoir Dogs, The Blair Witch Project and The Full Monty. Last years festival provided a platform for hits such as Open Water, Napoleon Dynamite, Garden State and Super-Size Me. The festival is held in the mountain resort of Park City, east of Salt Lake City, which sees its population rise from 7,500 to 45,000 during the festival. \\\"\",\n          \"Reboot ordered for EU patent law  A European Parliament committee has ordered a rewrite of the proposals for controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions.  The Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) said the Commission should re-submit the Computer Implemented Inventions Directive after MEPs failed to back it. It has had vocal critics who say it could favour large over small firms and impact open-source software innovation. Supporters say it would let firms protect their inventions. The directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect, in other words, \\\"computer implemented invention\\\". The draft law suffered setbacks when Poland, one of the largest EU member states, rejected its adoption twice in two months. Intense lobbying on the issue has started to gain momentum in some national parliaments putting them under immense pressure. Only two MEPs backed the draft law at the JURI meeting, with one voting to abstain.  Opponents of the draft directive welcomed the decision and said a new first reading of the proposals would give the EU a chance to have fuller debates about its implications in all member states. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its \\\"one-click shopping\\\" service, for example. Critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in Europe. This, they fear, could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. Supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing EU laws in line with the US. \",\n          \"Tory backing for ID cards  The Tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce ID cards.  The shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next weeks Commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory ID. The decision follows a \\\"tough meeting\\\" where some senior Tories argued vociferously against the move, party sources told the BBC. The bill, which ministers claim will tackle crime, terrorism and illegal immigration, is expected to be opposed by the Liberal Democrats.  They have said the scheme is \\\"deeply flawed\\\" and a waste of money. Sources within the Conservative Party told the BBC Michael Howard has always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary. The party has been \\\"agnostic\\\" on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence, the Tory source said. Despite giving their backing to ID cards, the Conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.  They said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would deliver them. And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether peoples privacy would be properly protected. \\\"It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,\\\" a spokesman said. \\\"It will do nothing to solve the immediate problems of rising crime and uncontrolled immigration.\\\"  Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: \\\"This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues concerns over ID cards. \\\"The Tories should have the courage to try and change public opinion not follow it.\\\" The new chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield QC warned there was a real risk that people on the \\\"margins of society\\\" would be driven into the hands of extremists. \\\"What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? They are going to be stopped. If they havent [ID cards] they are going to be detained.\\\" \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"labels\",\n          \"entertainment\",\n          \"tech\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Lawyers for news organisations said it was \\\"really vital\\\" for the responses of 250 potential jurors to be made public \\\"to serve as a check on the process\\\". Santa Barbara County Superior Court is due to consider the request on Monday. Mr Jackson denies child molestation. It is estimated his trial will cost Santa Barbara county up to $4m (xc2xa32.13m).  Meanwhile Michael Jacksons mother has said she is \\\"100% certain\\\" her son did not commit the child abuse charges he faces. The court is currently selecting 12 jurors and eight stand-by jurors for the trial, a process delayed until at least Thursday after a member of the stars legal team was hit by family illness. Defence lawyers argued against the bid by Associated Press and other news organisations to have potential jurors responses made public.  \\\"The release of the completed jury questionnaires does not serve any purpose other than to add to the sensationalist coverage of this case,\\\" a motion by Mr Jacksons lawyers stated. The estimated total costs of the trial, expected to last five months, range from $2.5m (xc2xa31.33m) to $4m (xc2xa32.13m) of local taxpayers money. Those estimates do not include costs to the city of Santa Maria, the Superior Court or for the investigation and prosecution of the case. The cost of security and other needs around the courthouse has been estimated at $40,000 (xc2xa321,000) per day, said Jason Stilwell, a special projects manager at the county administrators office.  Mr Jackson, 46, denies plying a boy with alcohol and molesting him. His mother Katherine Jackson told US TV network Fox News on Sunday that her pop star son told her he was innocent. \\\"I believe that for one reason - I know his character,\\\" she said. \\\"He loves children. You dont molest anything that you love.\\\" Describing Mr Jackson as \\\"a good person\\\", the mother-of-nine said she feared he would not be given a fair trial. \\\"I cant sleep thinking about what these wicked people might try to do to him,\\\" she said. \",\n          \"Game firm holds cast auditions  Video game firm Bioware is to hold open auditions for people to become cast members for future games.  The company, which makes role playing games such as Knights of the Old Republic and Neverwinter Nights, is seeking people aged 18 to 99. The Canada-based company says it was looking for \\\"a wide variety of people to use as face models for characters\\\". Everyone chosen to appear in a video game will receive a performers fee for the use of their image. The company is inviting people to come along to a shopping mall in West Edmonton, Alberta, on Friday and Saturday, bringing along a piece of photo identification.  \\\"There are hundreds and hundreds of characters in a typical Bioware game,\\\" said Shauna Perry, Biowares audio and external resources producer. \\\"Those people live in any city and village and so we need ordinary people, people with interesting faces.\\\" She added: \\\"Not everyone is a model in the world so we dont want just models in our games.\\\" People chosen to appear in a game will have their head scanned in three dimensions. Hundreds of photos of the persons head are taken so that a model of the head can be generated in 3D. \\\"The 3D model will look exactly like the person - its really quite incredible how detailed they are,\\\" said Ms Perry. She said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game. \\\"We cannot give people any control over how the images are used. \\\"But their face could be used in multiple games - so they could be the hero in one, the villain in another and just a merchant in a third.\\\" \",\n          \"Citizenship event for 18s touted  Citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their 18th birthday, Charles Clarke has said.  The idea will be tried as part of an overhaul of the way government approaches \\\"inclusive citizenship\\\" particularly for ethnic minorities. A pilot scheme based on ceremonies in Australia will start in October. Mr Clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents. Britains young black and Asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nations heritage as part of the governments new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups. Officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their \\\"other cultural identities\\\" alongside being British. The launch follows a row about the role of faith schools in Britain. On Monday school inspection chief David Bell, accused some Islamic schools of failing to teach pupils about their obligations to British society.  The Muslim Council of Britain said Ofsted boss Mr Bells comments were \\\"highly irresponsible\\\". The Home Office started work on its Community Cohesion and Race Equality Strategy last year and the outcome, launched on Wednesday, is called Improving Opportunity, Strengthening Society. It is aimed at tackling racism, exclusion, segregation and the rise in political and religious extremism. \\\"It represents a move away from the one-size-fits-all approach to focus on specifics within cultural groups,\\\" said a Home Office spokesman. \\\"It is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged.\\\" The spokesman highlighted specific issues that affect particular communities - for example people of south Asian origin tend to suffer from a high incidence of heart disease.  \\\"It is about drilling down and focusing on these sorts of problems,\\\" the spokesman added. Launching the initiative Mr Clarke said enormous progress had been made on race issues in recent years. He added: \\\"But while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving, some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare, education or housing. \\\"This strategy sets out the governments commitment to doing more to identify and respond to the specific needs of minorities in our society.\\\" Some 8% of the UK population described themselves as coming from a non-white ethnic minority in the 2001 Census.  The Downing Street Strategy Unit in 2003 said people from Indian and Chinese backgrounds were doing well on average, often outperforming white people in education and earnings. But those of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and black Caribbean origin were significantly more likely to be unemployed and earn less than whites, it said. The Home Office wants more initiatives which try to promote a sense of belonging by encouraging young people to take part in voluntary work. The programmes are designed to support the citizenship lessons already taking place in schools. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"business\",\n          \"tech\",\n          \"sport\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Lawyers for news organisations said it was \\\"really vital\\\" for the responses of 250 potential jurors to be made public \\\"to serve as a check on the process\\\". Santa Barbara County Superior Court is due to consider the request on Monday. Mr Jackson denies child molestation. It is estimated his trial will cost Santa Barbara county up to $4m (xc2xa32.13m).  Meanwhile Michael Jacksons mother has said she is \\\"100% certain\\\" her son did not commit the child abuse charges he faces. The court is currently selecting 12 jurors and eight stand-by jurors for the trial, a process delayed until at least Thursday after a member of the stars legal team was hit by family illness. Defence lawyers argued against the bid by Associated Press and other news organisations to have potential jurors responses made public.  \\\"The release of the completed jury questionnaires does not serve any purpose other than to add to the sensationalist coverage of this case,\\\" a motion by Mr Jacksons lawyers stated. The estimated total costs of the trial, expected to last five months, range from $2.5m (xc2xa31.33m) to $4m (xc2xa32.13m) of local taxpayers money. Those estimates do not include costs to the city of Santa Maria, the Superior Court or for the investigation and prosecution of the case. The cost of security and other needs around the courthouse has been estimated at $40,000 (xc2xa321,000) per day, said Jason Stilwell, a special projects manager at the county administrators office.  Mr Jackson, 46, denies plying a boy with alcohol and molesting him. His mother Katherine Jackson told US TV network Fox News on Sunday that her pop star son told her he was innocent. \\\"I believe that for one reason - I know his character,\\\" she said. \\\"He loves children. You dont molest anything that you love.\\\" Describing Mr Jackson as \\\"a good person\\\", the mother-of-nine said she feared he would not be given a fair trial. \\\"I cant sleep thinking about what these wicked people might try to do to him,\\\" she said. \",\n          \"Game firm holds cast auditions  Video game firm Bioware is to hold open auditions for people to become cast members for future games.  The company, which makes role playing games such as Knights of the Old Republic and Neverwinter Nights, is seeking people aged 18 to 99. The Canada-based company says it was looking for \\\"a wide variety of people to use as face models for characters\\\". Everyone chosen to appear in a video game will receive a performers fee for the use of their image. The company is inviting people to come along to a shopping mall in West Edmonton, Alberta, on Friday and Saturday, bringing along a piece of photo identification.  \\\"There are hundreds and hundreds of characters in a typical Bioware game,\\\" said Shauna Perry, Biowares audio and external resources producer. \\\"Those people live in any city and village and so we need ordinary people, people with interesting faces.\\\" She added: \\\"Not everyone is a model in the world so we dont want just models in our games.\\\" People chosen to appear in a game will have their head scanned in three dimensions. Hundreds of photos of the persons head are taken so that a model of the head can be generated in 3D. \\\"The 3D model will look exactly like the person - its really quite incredible how detailed they are,\\\" said Ms Perry. She said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game. \\\"We cannot give people any control over how the images are used. \\\"But their face could be used in multiple games - so they could be the hero in one, the villain in another and just a merchant in a third.\\\" \",\n          \"Citizenship event for 18s touted  Citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their 18th birthday, Charles Clarke has said.  The idea will be tried as part of an overhaul of the way government approaches \\\"inclusive citizenship\\\" particularly for ethnic minorities. A pilot scheme based on ceremonies in Australia will start in October. Mr Clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents. Britains young black and Asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nations heritage as part of the governments new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups. Officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their \\\"other cultural identities\\\" alongside being British. The launch follows a row about the role of faith schools in Britain. On Monday school inspection chief David Bell, accused some Islamic schools of failing to teach pupils about their obligations to British society.  The Muslim Council of Britain said Ofsted boss Mr Bells comments were \\\"highly irresponsible\\\". The Home Office started work on its Community Cohesion and Race Equality Strategy last year and the outcome, launched on Wednesday, is called Improving Opportunity, Strengthening Society. It is aimed at tackling racism, exclusion, segregation and the rise in political and religious extremism. \\\"It represents a move away from the one-size-fits-all approach to focus on specifics within cultural groups,\\\" said a Home Office spokesman. \\\"It is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged.\\\" The spokesman highlighted specific issues that affect particular communities - for example people of south Asian origin tend to suffer from a high incidence of heart disease.  \\\"It is about drilling down and focusing on these sorts of problems,\\\" the spokesman added. Launching the initiative Mr Clarke said enormous progress had been made on race issues in recent years. He added: \\\"But while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving, some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare, education or housing. \\\"This strategy sets out the governments commitment to doing more to identify and respond to the specific needs of minorities in our society.\\\" Some 8% of the UK population described themselves as coming from a non-white ethnic minority in the 2001 Census.  The Downing Street Strategy Unit in 2003 said people from Indian and Chinese backgrounds were doing well on average, often outperforming white people in education and earnings. But those of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and black Caribbean origin were significantly more likely to be unemployed and earn less than whites, it said. The Home Office wants more initiatives which try to promote a sense of belonging by encouraging young people to take part in voluntary work. The programmes are designed to support the citizenship lessons already taking place in schools. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"__label__business\",\n          \"__label__tech\",\n          \"__label__sport\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Lawyers for news organisations said it was \\\"really vital\\\" for the responses of 250 potential jurors to be made public \\\"to serve as a check on the process\\\". Santa Barbara County Superior Court is due to consider the request on Monday. Mr Jackson denies child molestation. It is estimated his trial will cost Santa Barbara county up to $4m (xc2xa32.13m).  Meanwhile Michael Jacksons mother has said she is \\\"100% certain\\\" her son did not commit the child abuse charges he faces. The court is currently selecting 12 jurors and eight stand-by jurors for the trial, a process delayed until at least Thursday after a member of the stars legal team was hit by family illness. Defence lawyers argued against the bid by Associated Press and other news organisations to have potential jurors responses made public.  \\\"The release of the completed jury questionnaires does not serve any purpose other than to add to the sensationalist coverage of this case,\\\" a motion by Mr Jacksons lawyers stated. The estimated total costs of the trial, expected to last five months, range from $2.5m (xc2xa31.33m) to $4m (xc2xa32.13m) of local taxpayers money. Those estimates do not include costs to the city of Santa Maria, the Superior Court or for the investigation and prosecution of the case. The cost of security and other needs around the courthouse has been estimated at $40,000 (xc2xa321,000) per day, said Jason Stilwell, a special projects manager at the county administrators office.  Mr Jackson, 46, denies plying a boy with alcohol and molesting him. His mother Katherine Jackson told US TV network Fox News on Sunday that her pop star son told her he was innocent. \\\"I believe that for one reason - I know his character,\\\" she said. \\\"He loves children. You dont molest anything that you love.\\\" Describing Mr Jackson as \\\"a good person\\\", the mother-of-nine said she feared he would not be given a fair trial. \\\"I cant sleep thinking about what these wicked people might try to do to him,\\\" she said. \",\n          \"Game firm holds cast auditions  Video game firm Bioware is to hold open auditions for people to become cast members for future games.

The company is inviting people to come along to a shopping mall in West Edmonton, Alberta, on Friday and Saturday, bringing along a piece of photo identification.  \\\"There are hundreds and hundreds of characters in a typical Bioware game,\\\" said Shauna Perry, Biowares audio and external resources producer. \\\"Those people live in any city and village and so we need ordinary people, people with interesting faces.\\\" She added: \\\"Not everyone is a model in the world so we dont want just models in our games.\\\" People chosen to appear in a game will have their head scanned in three dimensions. Hundreds of photos of the persons head are taken so that a model of the head can be generated in 3D. \\\"The 3D model will look exactly like the person - its really quite incredible how detailed they are,\\\" said Ms Perry. She said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game. \\\"We cannot give people any control over how the images are used. \\\"But their face could be used in multiple games - so they could be the hero in one, the villain in another and just a merchant in a third.\\\" \",\n          \"Citizenship event for 18s touted  Citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their 18th birthday, Charles Clarke has said.

Mr Clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents. Britains young black and Asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nations heritage as part of the governments new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups. Officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their \\\"other cultural identities\\\" alongside being British. The launch follows a row about the role of faith schools in Britain. On Monday school inspection chief David Bell, accused some Islamic schools of failing to teach pupils about their obligations to British society.  The Muslim Council of Britain said Ofsted boss Mr Bells comments were \\\"highly irresponsible\\\". The Home Office started work on its Community Cohesion and Race Equality Strategy last year and the outcome, launched on Wednesday, is called Improving Opportunity, Strengthening Society. It is aimed at tackling racism, exclusion, segregation and the rise in political and religious extremism. \\\"It represents a move away from the one-size-fits-all approach to focus on specifics within cultural groups,\\\" said a Home Office spokesman. \\\"It is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged.\\\" The spokesman highlighted specific issues that affect particular communities - for example people of south Asian origin tend to suffer from a high incidence of heart disease.  \\\"It is about drilling down and focusing on these sorts of problems,\\\" the spokesman added. Launching the initiative Mr Clarke said enormous progress had been made on race issues in recent years. He added: \\\"But while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving, some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare, education or housing. \\\"This strategy sets out the governments commitment to doing more to identify and respond to the specific needs of minorities in our society.\\\" Some 8% of the UK population described themselves as coming from a non-white ethnic minority in the 2001 Census.

But those of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and black Caribbean origin were significantly more likely to be unemployed and earn less than whites, it said.

Lawyers for news organisations said it was \\\"really vital\\\" for the responses of 250 potential jurors to be made public \\\"to serve as a check on the process\\\". Santa Barbara County Superior Court is due to consider the request on Monday. Mr Jackson denies child molestation. It is estimated his trial will cost Santa Barbara county up to $4m (xc2xa32.13m).  Meanwhile Michael Jacksons mother has said she is \\\"100% certain\\\" her son did not commit the child abuse charges he faces. The court is currently selecting 12 jurors and eight stand-by jurors for the trial, a process delayed until at least Thursday after a member of the stars legal team was hit by family illness. Defence lawyers argued against the bid by Associated Press and other news organisations to have potential jurors responses made public.  \\\"The release of the completed jury questionnaires does not serve any purpose other than to add to the sensationalist coverage of this case,\\\" a motion by Mr Jacksons lawyers stated. The estimated total costs of the trial, expected to last five months, range from $2.5m (xc2xa31.33m) to $4m (xc2xa32.13m) of local taxpayers money. Those estimates do not include costs to the city of Santa Maria, the Superior Court or for the investigation and prosecution of the case. The cost of security and other needs around the courthouse has been estimated at $40,000 (xc2xa321,000) per day, said Jason Stilwell, a special projects manager at the county administrators office.  Mr Jackson, 46, denies plying a boy with alcohol and molesting him. His mother Katherine Jackson told US TV network Fox News on Sunday that her pop star son told her he was innocent. \\\"I believe that for one reason - I know his character,\\\" she said. \\\"He loves children. You dont molest anything that you love.\\\" Describing Mr Jackson as \\\"a good person\\\", the mother-of-nine said she feared he would not be given a fair trial. \\\"I cant sleep thinking about what these wicked people might try to do to him,\\\" she said. \",\n          \"Game firm holds cast auditions  Video game firm Bioware is to hold open auditions for people to become cast members for future games.  The company, which makes role playing games such as Knights of the Old Republic and Neverwinter Nights, is seeking people aged 18 to 99. The Canada-based company says it was looking for \\\"a wide variety of people to use as face models for characters\\\". Everyone chosen to appear in a video game will receive a performers fee for the use of their image. The company is inviting people to come along to a shopping mall in West Edmonton, Alberta, on Friday and Saturday, bringing along a piece of photo identification.  \\\"There are hundreds and hundreds of characters in a typical Bioware game,\\\" said Shauna Perry, Biowares audio and external resources producer. \\\"Those people live in any city and village and so we need ordinary people, people with interesting faces.\\\" She added: \\\"Not everyone is a model in the world so we dont want just models in our games.\\\" People chosen to appear in a game will have their head scanned in three dimensions. Hundreds of photos of the persons head are taken so that a model of the head can be generated in 3D. \\\"The 3D model will look exactly like the person - its really quite incredible how detailed they are,\\\" said Ms Perry. She said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game. \\\"We cannot give people any control over how the images are used. \\\"But their face could be used in multiple games - so they could be the hero in one, the villain in another and just a merchant in a third.\\\" \",\n          \"Citizenship event for 18s touted  Citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their 18th birthday, Charles Clarke has said.  The idea will be tried as part of an overhaul of the way government approaches \\\"inclusive citizenship\\\" particularly for ethnic minorities. A pilot scheme based on ceremonies in Australia will start in October. Mr Clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents. Britains young black and Asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nations heritage as part of the governments new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups. Officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their \\\"other cultural identities\\\" alongside being British. The launch follows a row about the role of faith schools in Britain. On Monday school inspection chief David Bell, accused some Islamic schools of failing to teach pupils about their obligations to British society.  The Muslim Council of Britain said Ofsted boss Mr Bells comments were \\\"highly irresponsible\\\". The Home Office started work on its Community Cohesion and Race Equality Strategy last year and the outcome, launched on Wednesday, is called Improving Opportunity, Strengthening Society. It is aimed at tackling racism, exclusion, segregation and the rise in political and religious extremism. \\\"It represents a move away from the one-size-fits-all approach to focus on specifics within cultural groups,\\\" said a Home Office spokesman. \\\"It is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged.\\\" The spokesman highlighted specific issues that affect particular communities - for example people of south Asian origin tend to suffer from a high incidence of heart disease.  \\\"It is about drilling down and focusing on these sorts of problems,\\\" the spokesman added. Launching the initiative Mr Clarke said enormous progress had been made on race issues in recent years. He added: \\\"But while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving, some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare, education or housing. \\\"This strategy sets out the governments commitment to doing more to identify and respond to the specific needs of minorities in our society.\\\" Some 8% of the UK population described themselves as coming from a non-white ethnic minority in the 2001 Census.  The Downing Street Strategy Unit in 2003 said people from Indian and Chinese backgrounds were doing well on average, often outperforming white people in education and earnings. But those of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and black Caribbean origin were significantly more likely to be unemployed and earn less than whites, it said. The Home Office wants more initiatives which try to promote a sense of belonging by encouraging young people to take part in voluntary work. The programmes are designed to support the citizenship lessons already taking place in schools. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n

senior eu politician says javier solana eu foreign policy chief says phone tap evidence works in the courts of other european countries human rights groups top police officers and many mps say allowing the evidence would remove the need to detain terror suspects without charge but home secretary charles clarke says the evidence would not make much difference to these cases mr solana told itv1s jonathan dimbleby programme phone tap evidence in court works it is normal that it is done it would be naive not to do it it would be naive not to use this technological thing that we have at our disposal mr solanas comments come the day after sir ian blair the newly appointed metropolitan police commissioner said he was in favour of phone tap evidence under the anti terrorism crimes and security act 2001 foreign terror suspects can be detained in british jails without trial or charge several suspects have been detained under these powers because evidence against them was deemed too sensitive to be heard in court some of this evidence is believed to be telephone intercepts human rights group liberty has argued that if intercept evidence could be heard these detainees could be brought to trial but critics of phone tap trials say the evidence is often weak and can expose the methods of the security services the home secretary says intercepts would not make much difference because cases against terror suspects frequently rely on other kinds of surveillance but mr clarke has been forced to change the regime of detention without trial after law lords ruled it illegal he has opted for a system of control orders whereby suspects both british and foreign can be held under house arrest or surveillance these orders will again involve a uk opt out of parts of the european convention on human rights while accepting that people have to be prepared for a possible terrorist attack mr solana said he had qualms about the home secretarys new plans we have to fight terrorism
